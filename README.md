Save Earth!

Hi! My name is Kelly, and I live in NYC!
I created this website SAVE EARTH because I love helping the environment and volunteering to help out!
I believe that we really need to start doing something to help the environment, or when these environmental issues become really bad, we won't be able to do anything to help.
So, I believe we should do what we can when we still can.
